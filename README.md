# Tic-Tac-Toe

- tic-tac-toe game
- player assigned either X or O at beginning
- player can pick spots on board using letters of alphabet
- player cannot input a spot that is already taken or else turn will be skipped 
- problem: when either player or program wins, does not print "You win!" or "You lost!". Ends in error: local variables playerpoints or AIpoints referenced before assignment
- problem: code is repetitive ; could be simplified
